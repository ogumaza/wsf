// The Photo Channel 1.1's mood effect, modelled on the channel's code. The effect isn't part of AXFX. The channel
// defines it as an effect class of NW4R SND (FxBase, with its virtual functions at 0x801f3d70). The model is kept with
// the AXFX models because it runs on the same frames. As the channel starts, its sound manager puts the effect on bus B
// (0x80048a40). The effect starts off. While a photo with a mood is shown, the channel turns it on (0x80049614) and
// sets its mode by the mood (SetMode, 0x80049820). Moods 1 to 4 give modes 1, 4, 3 and 2 (0x800212c8). The channel
// also moves the music's sends from the main mix and bus C to bus B. The effect's output then takes the music's place:
//
// - Mode 1, an echo: each sample adds 0.6 of the effect's output from 60 frames before. An 11-tap band-pass filter from
//   1 kHz to 14 kHz then runs on the sum.
// - Mode 2, an octave down: two grains, 32 frames apart, read the input at half speed. Each has a Hamming window 64
//   frames long. The output is 1.2 times their sum.
// - Mode 3, a vibrato: each sample reads the input from 170 to 214 samples before, by a sine with a period of 30
//   frames. 0.2 of the effect's output from 60 frames before is mixed with 0.8 of that.
// - Mode 4, an old radio: the two channels make one. A 21-tap band-pass filter from 1 kHz to 3.4 kHz runs on it. A
//   random gain from 0.9 to 1.0 changes every 8 samples, and the low 7 bits of each sample are cleared. Both channels
//   get the result.
//
// The arithmetic is in 32-bit integers that wrap, with gains in 4096ths. The constructor (0x8004984c) builds the
// filters, the window and the vibrato's offsets from nw4r::math's table of sines. The model builds them the same way.
// UpdateBuffer (0x80049d80) handles the left and right channels and leaves the surround channel as it is.
