// AXFXChorusExp and AXFXChorus, the RVL SDK's chorus for an aux bus, modelled on the games' code. ChorusExp delays each
// channel by a time that a sine LFO varies. A 4-tap interpolator reads the delayed signal. Chorus is the wrapper that
// NW4R's FxChorus calls. Its parameters are a delay, a variation and the LFO's period, in ms. The wrapper runs
// ChorusExp with no feedback and no other buses. The builds of October 2006 (WarioWare: Smooth Moves) and December 2006
// (Wii Sports and Wii Play) have the same code. Comments give Wii Sports' addresses, and Smooth Moves' after "October
// 2006". Wii Play's are Wii Sports' less 0x618.
