// AXFXDelay, the RVL SDK's delay for an aux bus, modelled on the games' code. Each channel runs through a delay line
// with feedback and an output gain. The arithmetic is in integers. The builds of October 2006 (WarioWare: Smooth Moves)
// and December 2006 (Wii Sports and Wii Play) have the same code. Comments give Wii Sports' addresses, and Smooth
// Moves' after "October 2006". Wii Play's are Wii Sports' less 0x618.
