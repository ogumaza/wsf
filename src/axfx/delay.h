// AXFXDelay and AXFXDelayExp, the RVL SDK's delays for an aux bus, modelled on the games' code. The arithmetic is in
// integers.
//
// AXFXDelay runs each channel through a delay line with feedback and an output gain. The builds of October 2006
// (WarioWare: Smooth Moves) and December 2006 (Wii Sports and Wii Play) have the same code. Comments give Wii Sports'
// addresses, and Smooth Moves' after "October 2006". Wii Play's are Wii Sports' less 0x618.
//
// AXFXDelayExp gives the three channels one delay. A low-pass filter shapes the input that goes into each line, and the
// feedback adds to it. The effect can take another bus's samples as input too, and send its output to a third bus.
// NW4R's FxDelay of 2009 calls it. Comments give Pokémon Rumble's addresses. The game links the build of February 2009.
