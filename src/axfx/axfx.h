// The RVL SDK's effects for AX's aux buses (AXFX), modelled on the games' code. A game registers an effect's callback
// for a bus. In each AX frame, the callback takes the bus's samples as 32-bit integers: 96 in each of the three
// channels of AX's stereo mode (left, right and surround). It replaces them with the effect's output. The DSP mixes the
// output back into the main mix two frames later (see ax::System).
//
// Each model follows the game's functions operation for operation, in single-precision floats. It then gives the same
// samples as the game's code on Broadway. That requires the compiler to keep each multiply and add apart:
// xsflib_project turns off their contraction into fused multiply-adds for every target, with clang-cl too.
